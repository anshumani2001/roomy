Add multiple images on an interactive carousel.

Just type in your location and your PG will show up on a map! This is done via the mapbox API which uses geocoding.

The homepage has a cluster map with all the PGs which makes finding PGs near your location easier.

This website has full authentication and authorization for users to edit their own PGs. This was done using Passport.js.
